# jCrypt_py
An Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption/decryption algorithm implementation in Python. This
is not meant to serve as a serious implementation of AES for any practical use, but rather as
a personal project for my own enjoyment. I may also add more encryption/decryption algorithms in
the future, such as RC4/RC5/RC6 and DES.
